<h1>Project: Bank Churn Estimator</h1>
<h3><b>PROBLEM:</b> Bank of Freedom expects a high ratio of customer churn in the last year.</h3>
<br />
<h3><b>SOLUTION:</b> Predict the group of customers that is about to leave, so the bank has the opportunity to offer them deals that potentially will change their minds.</h3>
<br />
<h3><b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Bank of Freedom is a big corporation that has its offices around the US. Recently, the department of Data Analysts found out that the company began facing a huge customer churn ratio due to the COVID19 event. Based on research, many customers lost their jobs and faced financial crises that caused them to consider closing bank accounts with some organizations that offer high-interest rates. So, now Bank of Freedom is trying to find out which group of customers is about to leave so they can target them properly (applying some promotions or other techniques).</h3>
